### Swift Package Manager
Swift Package Manager is a tool for managing the distribution of Swift code. Itâ€™s integrated with the Swift build system to automate the process of downloading, compiling, and linking dependencies.

Xcode 11+ is required to build TableManipulator using Swift Package Manager.

To integrate TableManipulator into your Xcode project using Swift Package Manager, add it to the dependencies value of your Package.swift:

```
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/ArtyomKalugin/TableManipulator", .upToNextMajor(from: "1.0.0"))
]
```
